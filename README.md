Executed an end-to-end data engineering and analytics pipeline on NYC Taxi datasets using Microsoft Fabric. Built and orchestrated two key pipelines:

Staging Pipeline (pl_stg_processing_nyctaxi) – for ingestion, cleaning, and transformation of raw taxi trip data.

Presentation Pipeline (pl_pres_processing_nyctaxi) – for aggregation, metrics generation, and analytics-ready outputs.

Key highlights:

Designed modular, scalable, and reusable data pipelines.

Implemented data cleaning, transformation, and optimization strategies.

Structured datasets for business insights on trips, fares, and demand patterns.

Documented the process for reproducibility and collaboration.
